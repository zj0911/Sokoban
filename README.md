Improved basic sokoban game requirements, such as characters pushing boxes, entering the next level, restarting the game, background music, etc.
The problem is that the buttons will fail in certain situations, such as when the player has already played the game, then clicks the button to go to the next level, and then clicks the button again to go to the previous level, and the level information will not refresh.
If you need this code, you can update the code yourself.
